### new module:extras/evaluators.Roulette(rollingCurve, fixedCurve, polePoint, [revolutions])

**Augments:** <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a>

A <a href="Curve.md">curve evaluator object</a> for a curve drawn by a curve that rolls along another curve whose position is fixed.

This object generates two-dimensional curves, which are returned by the <code>evaluate</code> method as three-dimensional points with the third element (Z coordinate) set to 0.

#### Parameters

* `rollingCurve` (Type: Object)<br>A <a href="Curve.md">curve evaluator object</a> that describes the curve that rolls to generate the roulette curve. This curve is assumed to be a smooth, convex closed curve such as a circle. The curve evaluator object <i>should</i> support extrapolating curve positions outside its <code>endPoints()</code> range.
* `fixedCurve` (Type: Object)<br>A <a href="Curve.md">curve evaluator object</a> that describes the curve on which the rolling curve will move. This curve is assumed to be smooth at every point; this includes periodic waves and circles. The curve evaluator object <i>should</i> support extrapolating curve positions outside its <code>endPoints()</code> range.
* `polePoint` (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>X and Y coordinates of a point, from the same coordinate system (reference frame) as <i>rollingCurve</i>, that will generate the roulette curve.
* `revolutions` (Type: number) (optional)<br>The roulette will be generated by rolling the rolling curve the distance of the fixed curve times this parameter; this will be reflected in this instance's <code>endPoints</code> method. This can be an integer or a noninteger number. If null, undefined, or omitted, the default is 1.

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_accel'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#accel(u)

Finds an approximate acceleration vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>accel</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the velocity vector.

The <b>acceleration</b> of a curve is a vector which is the second-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>.

#### Parameters

* `u` (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.

#### Return Value

An array describing an acceleration vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_arcLength'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#arcLength(u)

Finds an approximate arc length (distance) between the start of this
curve and the point at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>arcLength</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, calculates a numerical integral using the velocity vector.

The <b>arc length</b> function returns a number; if the curve is "smooth", this is the integral, from the starting point to <code>u</code>, of the length of the velocity vector.

#### Parameters

* `u` (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.

#### Return Value

The approximate arc length of this curve at the given U coordinate. (Type: number)

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_changeEnds'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#changeEnds(ep1, ep2)

Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that is generated using
the same formula as this one (and uses the same U coordinates),
but has a different set of end points.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the path of a curve
from [0, &pi;] to [0, &pi;/8].

Note, however, that in general, shrinking
the range of a curve will not shrink the length of a curve
in the same proportion, unless the curve's path runs at
constant speed with respect to time. For example, shrinking the range of a curve
from [0, 1] to [0, 0.5] will not generally result in a curve that's exactly half as
long as the original curve.

For some curves, this method can
also be used to grow the path of the curve.

#### Parameters

* `ep1` (Type: number)<br>New start point of the curve.
* `ep2` (Type: number)<br>New end point of the curve.

#### Return Value

Return value. (Type: <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a>)

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_endPoints'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#endPoints()

Returns the starting and ending U coordinates of this curve.

#### Return Value

A two-element array. The first element is the starting coordinate of
the curve, and the second is its ending coordinate.
Returns <code>[0, 1]</code> if the evaluator doesn't implement an <code>endPoints</code>
method.

<a name='extras_evaluators_Roulette.epitrochoid'></a>
### (static) module:extras/evaluators~Roulette.epitrochoid(outerRadius, rollerRadius, distFromRollerCenter, [rotationDegrees], [revolutions])

Creates a <a href="Curve.md">curve evaluator object</a> for an <i>epitrochoid</i>, a curve drawn by a circle that rolls along the outside
of another circle, whose position is fixed, with a center of (0,0).
The rolling circle will start at the positive X axis of the fixed circle
unless otherwise given in the parameter <code>rotationDegrees</code>.

### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#fitRange(ep1, ep2)

Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to fit the given range.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the range of U coordinates

of U coordinates. Note that these positions will not generally be
evenly spaced along the curve unless the curve uses
an arc-length parameterization.

#### Parameters

of U coordinates. Note that these positions will not generally be
evenly spaced along the curve unless the curve uses
an arc-length parameterization. The positions will be in the form of objects with
up to four properties: x, y, z, and w retrieve the first, second, third,
and fourth coordinate of each position, respectively.

#### Parameters

* `count` (Type: number)<br>Number of positions to generate. Throws an error if this number is 0. If this value is 1, returns an array containing the starting point of this curve.

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_jerk'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#jerk(u)

Finds an approximate jerk vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>jerk</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the acceleration vector.

The <b>jerk</b> of a curve is a vector which is the third-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>.

#### Parameters

elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_normal'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#normal(u)

Finds an approximate principal normal vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>normal</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using the velocity vector.

The <b>principal normal</b> of a curve is the derivative of the "normalized" velocity
vector divided by that derivative's length. The normal returned by this method
<i>should</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>. (Compare with <a href="Surface.md#Surface_gradient">Surface#gradient</a>.)

#### Parameters

* `u` (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.

#### Return Value

An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='extras_evaluators_Roulette.rose'></a>
### (static) module:extras/evaluators~Roulette.rose(num, denom, distFromInnerCenter, [rotationDegrees])

form of hypotrochoid (roulette curve generated when one circle rolls
inside another fixed circle).

#### Parameters

* `num` (Type: number)<br>Integer numerator of a parameter that determines the petal form of the rose. For example, the rose is symmetrical if 'num' is even and 'den' is 1.
* `denom` (Type: number)<br>Integer denominator of a parameter that determines the petal form of the rose. Must not be 0.
* `distFromInnerCenter` (Type: number)<br>Distance from the center of the rolling circle to the drawing pen.

The <b>tangent vector</b> is the same as the velocity vector, but "normalized" to a unit vector.

#### Parameters

* `u` (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.

#### Return Value

An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_toArcLengthParam'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#toArcLengthParam()

Gets a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to
an <i>arc length parameterization</i>. Arc length
parameterization allows for moving along a curve's path at a uniform
speed and for generating points which are spaced evenly along that
path -- both features are more difficult with most other kinds
of curve parameterization.

The <i>end points</i> of the curve (obtained by calling the <code>endPoints</code>
method) will be (0, N), where N is the distance to the end of the curve from its
start.

When converting to an arc length parameterization, the curve
should be continuous and have a speed greater than 0 at every
point on the curve. The arc length parameterization used in
this method is approximate.

#### Return Value

Return value. Returns this object if this curve already uses an arc length parameterization. (Type: <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a>)

#### Examples

The following example uses the arc-length
parameterization to generate, uniformly at random, a point that lies anywhere
on a curve.

    var arclen = curve.toArcLengthParam();
    var point = arclen.evaluate(Math.random()*arclen.getLength())

* `distFromCenter` (Type: number)<br>Distance from the center of the rolling circle to the drawing pen.
* `distance` (Type: number) (optional)<br>Distance to roll the inner circle along the X axis to generate the epitrochoid. This can be an integer or a noninteger number. If null, undefined, or omitted, the default is 2 \* &pi; \* <code>radius</code>.

<a name='extras_evaluators.Roulette_velocity'></a>
### module:extras/evaluators.Roulette#velocity(u)

Finds an approximate velocity vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="Curve.md">Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>velocity</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the position (from the <code>evaluate</code> method).

The <b>velocity</b> of a curve is a vector which is the derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.md">unit vector</a>.
