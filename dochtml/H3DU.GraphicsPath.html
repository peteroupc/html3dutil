described by this path. The list will contain one curve evaluator object for each disconnected
portion of the path. For example, if the path contains one polygon, the list will contain
one curve object. And if the path is empty, the list will be empty too. Each curve
takes U coordinates that range from 0 to 1, depending on how far the point is from the start or
the end of the path (similar to arc-length parameterization). Each curve
returns a 3-element array containing
the X, Y, and Z coordinates of the point lying on the curve at the given
"u" position (however, the z will always be 0 since paths can currently
only be 2-dimensional).

Closer to 0 means closer to this path, and closer to 1 means closer to "other". If the input paths contain arc segments that differ in the large arc and sweep flags, the flags from the first path's arc are used if "t" is less than 0.5; and the flags from the second path's arc are used otherwise.<p>For a nonlinear interpolation, define a function that takes a value that usually ranges from 0 through 1 and generally returns a value that usually ranges from 0 through 1, and pass the result of that function to this method.

path's shape. The following points apply to this method:<ul>
<li>This method treats unclosed subpaths as implicitly closed
by connecting their endPoints with their start points.

of line segments, so curves and arcs are converted to line
segments before applying the operation.

or holes. Subpaths that are holes have the opposite winding
order (clockwise or counterclockwise) from the subpath
that contains them.

"extras/path.js". Example:<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="extras/path.js">&lt;/script></pre>

<h3> (static) H3DU.GraphicsPath.GraphicsPath.fromString(str)</h3>Creates a graphics path from a string whose format follows
the SVG specification.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>str</code> (Type: string)<br>A string, in the SVG path format, representing a two-dimensional path. An SVG path consists of a number of path segments, starting with a single letter, as follows: <ul> <li>M/m (x y) - Moves the current position to (x, y). Further XY pairs specify line segments. <li>L/l (x y) - Specifies line segments to the given XY points. <li>H/h (x) - Specifies horizontal line segments to the given X points. <li>V/v (y) - Specifies vertical line segments to the given Y points. <li>Q/q (cx cx x y) - Specifies quadratic B&eacute;zier curves (see quadraticCurveTo). <li>T/t (x y) - Specifies quadratic curves tangent to the previous quadratic curve. <li>C/c (c1x c1y c2x c2y x y) - Specifies cubic B&eacute;zier curves (see bezierCurveTo). <li>S/s (c2x c2y x y) - Specifies cubic curves tangent to the previous cubic curve. <li>A/a (rx ry rot largeArc sweep x y) - Specifies arcs (see arcSvgTo). "largeArc" and "sweep" are flags, "0" for false and "1" for true. "rot" is in degrees. <li>Z/z - Closes the current path; similar to adding a line segment to the first XY point given in the last M/m command. </ul> Lower-case letters mean any X and Y coordinates are relative to the current position of the path. Each group of parameters can be repeated in the same path segment. Each parameter after the starting letter is separated by whitespace and/or a single comma, and the starting letter can be separated by whitespace. This separation can be left out as long as doing so doesn't introduce ambiguity.
