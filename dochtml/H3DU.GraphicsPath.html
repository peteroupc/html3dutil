<h3> H3DU.GraphicsPath#union(path, [flatness])</h3>Computes the combination of this path's shape with another

of line segments, so curves and arcs are converted to line
segments before applying the operation.

or holes. Subpaths that are holes have the opposite winding
order (clockwise or counterclockwise) from the subpath
that contains them.
