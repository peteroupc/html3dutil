<h3> (static) H3DU.Meshes.createBox(xSize, ySize, zSize, [inward])</h3>Creates a mesh of a box (rectangular prism), which
will be centered at the origin.
See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.html">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.
Will create texture coordinates such that the same texture
is used on each face of the box. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. The resulting mesh buffer
will use 36 vertex indices divided into 12 triangles, with each
face using two triangles. The faces will be ordered as follows:
Negative X face, positive X face, negative Y face,
positive Y face, negative Z face, positive Z face.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>xSize</code> (Type: number)<br>Width of the box.<li><code>ySize</code> (Type: number)<br>Height of the box.<li><code>zSize</code> (Type: number)<br>Depth of the box. If xSize, ySize, and zSize are the same number, the result is a cube.<li><code>inward</code> (Type: boolean) (optional)<br>If true, the normals generated by this method will point inward; otherwise, outward. Should normally be false unless the box will be viewed from the inside.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The generated mesh. (Type: MeshBuffer)<a name='H3DU.Meshes.createCapsule'></a>
<h3> (static) H3DU.Meshes.createCapsule([radius], [length], [slices], [stacks], [middleStacks], [flat], [inside])</h3>Creates a mesh of a capsule, centered at the origin.
The length of the capsule will run along the Z axis. (If the capsule
has a high length and a very low radius, it will resemble a 3D line
with rounded corners.)<p>
Will also generate texture coordinates such that the V (vertical)
coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the negative
to positive Z axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive X axis. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. <p>
If the "length" parameter is 0, the X, Y, and Z coordinates of a point on the solid
are as described in Meshes.createSphere.
See the "<a href="tutorial-shapes.html">Creating Shapes</a>" tutorial.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>radius</code> (Type: number) (optional)<br>Radius of each spherical end of the capsule. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 1.<li><code>length</code> (Type: number) (optional)<br>Length of the middle section. May be null or omitted, in which case the default is 1.

Should normally be false unless the capsule will be viewed from the inside.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The generated mesh. (Type: MeshBuffer)<a name='H3DU.Meshes.createClosedCylinder'></a>
<h3> (static) H3DU.Meshes.createClosedCylinder(baseRad, topRad, height, slices, stacks, [flat], [inside])</h3>Creates a mesh of a closed cylinder or closed cone. The cylinder's base will
be centered at the origin and its height will run along the
positive Z axis. The base and top will be included in the mesh if
their radius is greater than 0. Will generate texture coordinates for
the cylinder and for the base and top.
The base's and top's texture coordinates will be such that the
texture will be flat as seen from either. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. <p>
See Meshes.createCylinder for information on how texture

function createClosedCone(radius,height,slices) {
return Meshes.createClosedCylinder(radius,0,height,slices,1);
}</pre><a name='H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder'></a>
<h3> (static) H3DU.Meshes.createCylinder(baseRad, topRad, height, [slices], [stacks], [flat], [inside])</h3>Creates a mesh of a cylinder or cone. The cylinder's base will
be centered at the origin and its height will run along the
positive Z axis. The base and top themselves will not be
included in the mesh.<p>
Texture coordinates for the cylinder (other than the base) will
be generated such that the V (vertical)
coordinates start from the bottom of the texture and increase from the origin
to the positive Z axis, and the U (horizontal) coordinates start from the left of the
texture and increase from the positive X to positive Y to negative X to negative
Y to positive X axis. Texture coordinates are generated assuming that the coordinate (0,0)
is at the lower-left corner of the texture and (1,1) is at the upper-right
corner. <p>
The X, Y, and Z coordinates of a point on the cylinder are
<code>(-R*cos(&lambda;), -R*sin(&lambda;), H*&phi;)</code>,
where &phi; = <code>(&pi;/2 + L)/&pi;</code>, L is the latitude in radians,
&lambda; is the longitude in radians, H = <code>height</code>,
R = <code>baseRad + (topRad - baseRad) * &phi;</code>,
and west and south latitudes and
longitudes are negative. (The formula for converting latitude
and longitude is mentioned here because their meaning depends on
exactly how the texture coordinates are generated on the cylinder.
It assumes that in the texture, longitudes range from -180&deg; to 0&deg; to 180&deg; from
left to right, and latitudes range from 90&deg; to 0&deg; to -90&deg; from top to bottom.)<p>

Assuming the Y axis points up, the X axis right,
and the Z axis toward the viewer, the first vertex in the outer edge
of the 2D disk will be at the 12 o'clock position.
