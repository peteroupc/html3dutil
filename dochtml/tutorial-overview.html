<h2>Public-Domain Geometry Utilities Library</h2><p>This page will introduce the <a href="https://github.com/peteroupc/html3dutil"><strong>Geometry Utilities Library</strong></a>, an open-source JavaScript library that I wrote.</p>
<p>This library contains classes and utility methods to represent 3-D geometries, including curves and surfaces, in JavaScript, and methods that support the development of 3D applications, including HTML applications that use the 3-D canvas.</p>
<p>The library differs from many others because this one is in the public domain, so no permission is required to use it.</p>
<p>This page includes information on how to use the Geometry Utilities Library and an overview of its features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Geometry Utilities Library was formerly called the Public-Domain HTML 3D Library.  Classes that involved the HTML 3D canvas, shaders, or the 3-D scene graph were removed, to make this library much more general-purpose.  In any case, such classes are not as trivial to port to other 3-D rendering APIs or other programming languages as classes that merely generate and store 3-D geometry or implement math functions (however, shader-based filters are still included as extras, even though the Geometry Utilities Library currently doesn't use them directly).</p>

<h2>Example</h2><p>The following is a screen shot of a scene generated with the help of the former Public Domain HTML 3D Library.  Currently, however, the Geometry Utilities library has no means to render 3-D geometry directly.</p>

<p>The following sections detail how an application that renders 3-D graphics can use this library.</p>
<p><a id=The_Camera></a></p>
<h3>The &quot;Camera&quot;</h3><p>The <code>MathUtil</code> class contains methods that support the concepts of a &quot;projection transform&quot; and a &quot;view transform&quot;, as are common in many 3D rendering libraries. If we
use the concept of a &quot;camera&quot;, the projection is like setting the camera's focus and lens, and the view transform is like setting its position and orientation. <code>MathUtil</code> has methods for generating 4x4 matrices that represent some kinds of projection and view transformations, including <code>MathUtil.mat4perspective</code> (a perspective projection) and <code>MathUtil.mat4lookat</code> (a look-at view transform). For more information, see <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/989978/The-Camera-and-the-Projection-and-View-Transforms"><strong><em>The &quot;Camera&quot; and Geometric Transforms</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p><a id=3D_Models></a></p>
<h3>3D Models</h3><p>Most 3D scenes are made up of <em>meshes</em>, or the triangles, lines, and points that make up a geometric three-dimensional object. Meshes can be simple, such as a cube, or very complex, such as a town model complete with houses. You create a mesh using the <code>MeshBuffer</code> class, or create a built-in geometric shape using a method in the <code>Meshes</code> class. The example below shows how you can create a box mesh:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>// Create a box mesh 10 units in width, 20 units
// in height, and 25 units in depth
var mesh=Meshes.createBox(10,20,25);</code></pre><p>Here are some other built-in methods for creating meshes. This page doesn't explain all the features or parameters in the <code>Meshes</code> class; for that, see the
<a href="http://peteroupc.github.io/html3dutil/Meshes.html">Meshes API documentation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><dfn><code>Meshes.createSphere(radius)</code></dfn>
<br>Creates a sphere with the given <code>radius</code>.</li>
<li><dfn><code>Meshes.createCylinder(base, top, height)</code></dfn>
<br>Creates a cylinder with the given <code>base</code> radius, <code>top</code> radius, and <code>height</code>. Can be used
to create a cone if <code>base</code> or <code>top</code> is <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><dfn><code>Meshes.createClosedCylinder(base, top, height)</code></dfn>
<br>Like <code>createCylinder</code>, except it also covers the base and top.</li>
<li><dfn><code>Meshes.createPartialDisk(inner, outer, start, sweep)</code></dfn>
<br>Creates a circular ring, of radius <code>outer</code> with a hole of radius <code>inner</code>, starting at <code>start</code>
degrees and sweeping <code>sweep</code> degrees.</li>
<li><dfn><code>Meshes.createDisk(inner, outer)</code></dfn>
<br>Same as calling <code>createPartialDisk</code> with <code>start</code> 0 and <code>sweep</code> 360.</li>
</ul>
<p>The methods described above return a <code>MeshBuffer</code> object describing the appropriate mesh's geometry.  Methods that can be called on a <code>MeshBuffer</code> include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><dfn><code>meshBuffer.setColor(color)</code></dfn>
<br>Gives all vertices in a mesh a particular color. <code>color</code> can be an HTML color (&quot;#ff0000&quot;), CSS color (&quot;red&quot;), RGB color(&quot;rgb(20, 30, 40)&quot;) or HSL color(&quot;hsl(20, 50%, 50%)&quot;), or a set of values from 0 to 1 (example: <code>[1.0,0.5,0.0]</code>).
See my <a href="https://peteroupc.github.io/html3dutil/tutorial-colors.html"><strong>colors tutorial</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id=Shapes></a></p>
<h3>Shapes</h3><p>The <code>Shape</code> constructor method assigns a linear or perspective transformation (including shifting position, scaling, and rotation) to meshes.  The library calls this a 3D shape.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>// Create a shape based on the mesh
var shape=new Shape(mesh);
// Move it 1 unit along the X axis
shape.setPosition(1,0,0);</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The appearance of a 3D shape's surface is known in the 3D graphics world as a <em>material</em>. It includes textures (images), colors, and light reflection parameters. Materials are not directly supported by this geometry library, not least because there are many ways to describe a material's parameters, as well as many ways to implement the rendering behavior of materials associated with shapes, such as physically-based rendering, cartoon styling, constant-color shading, the Blinn&ndash;Phong model, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are details on some of the <code>Shape</code> class's methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><dfn><code>shape.setPosition(x, y, z)</code></dfn>
<br>Sets the shape's position to the given coordinates.</li>
<li><dfn><code>shape.setScale(x, y, z)</code></dfn>
<br>Sets the shape's scaling along the x, y, and z axes. Examples: (1, 1, 1) means no scaling, (2, 1, 1) means a doubled width, (1, 1, 0.5) means a halved depth.</li>
<li><dfn><code>shape.getTransform().setRotation(angle, x, y, z)</code></dfn>
<br>Sets the shape's rotation given an angle in degrees, and an axis of rotation (the x, y, and z parameters). Example: (40, 1, 0, 0) means a 40-degree rotation around the X axis (x is 1 in the axis of rotation).</li>
<li><dfn><code>shape.copy()</code></dfn>
<br>Creates a copy of this shape.</li>
</ul>
<p><a id=The_Render_Loop></a></p>
<h3>The Render Loop</h3><p>An important part of a 3D application is the render loop. The render loop is a block of code that is called many times a second (or many &quot;frames&quot; a second) to redraw the 3D scene. Each frame, the state of the application is updated, and the 3D scene is re-rendered to account for that state. The exact details of rendering depend on the 3D rendering library in use; the Geometry Utilities Library has no means to directly render 3D objects.</p>
<p>For example, in an HTML Web page, a render loop could look like the following; it depends on the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API implemented in most modern Web browsers.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source"><code>// Set up the render loop
var rafCallback = function(time){
 // This will be called once each frame.
 // Render the scene here before calling
 // requestAnimationFrame again
 requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback);
});
requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback);</code></pre><p>In this example, the callback to <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> takes a parameter (here &quot;time&quot;), containing the number of milliseconds since the page was started.&nbsp; This can be used to implement frame-rate independent animations.</p>
