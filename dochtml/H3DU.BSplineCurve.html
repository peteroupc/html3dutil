<h3> H3DU.BSplineCurve(controlPoints, knots, [bits])</h3><p><b>Augments:</b> <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a></p>A <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">curve evaluator object</a> for a B-spline (basis spline) curve.
A B-spline curve is a parametric curve based on polynomial functions.
Each polynomial is generated using one or more
<i>control points</i>, which more or less follow the path of the curve,
and a <i>knot vector</i>, which determines, more or less, where each control
point is spaced along the curve. Together with rational B-spline curves (see
below), this makes B-spline curves very powerful,
since they can describe nearly all curves commonly used in computer
graphics, including line segments, circles, ellipses, parabolas, and
irregular smooth curves.
<p><b>B&eacute;zier Curves</b><p>
A B&eacute;zier curve is defined by a series of control points, where
the first and last control points define the end points of the curve, and
the remaining control points define the curve's shape, though they don't
necessarily cross the curve. An important property of these curves is
that the bounding box of the curve is contained within the bounding box
of the control points. Another important property is that the starting direction
is the same as the direction from the
first to the second control point, and the ending direction is the same as the
direction from the next-to-last to last control point.<p>
B&eacute;zier curves are a subset of B-spline curves
(see <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.fromBezierCurve">H3DU.BSplineCurve.fromBezierCurve</a>).<p>
Line segments are degree-1 B&eacute;zier curves with two control points.<p>
A B&eacute;zier curve's knot vector consists of as many zeros as the number
of control points, followed by that many ones. For example, a degree-3 (cubic)
B&eacute;zier curve contains four control points and the following knot vector:
<code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]</code>.
<p><b>Non-Uniform Curves</b><p>
A non-uniform B-spline curve is one whose knot vector is not evenly spaced,
that is, the difference between one knot and the next isn't the same.
<p><b>Rational Curves</b><p>
A rational B-spline curve is an N-dimensional curve with N plus one coordinates
per control point (<i>homogeneous coordinates</i>). B-spline algorithms
work the same way with homogeneous coordinates as with conventional
coordinates, but if N-dimensional points are wanted, use the <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.DIVIDE_BIT">H3DU.BSplineCurve.DIVIDE_BIT</a>
flag to divide each coordinate by the last (and omit the last coordinate)
to convert to N-dimensional points.<p>
Rational B-spline curves can describe circles and ellipses, which non-rational B-spline curves can't.<p>
Note that some B-spline packages define rational B-spline curves as using control points and weights, that is,
N-dimensional control points in conventional coordinates, along with a separate number, or <i>weight</i>,
for each control point. To convert such control points to homogeneous coordinates, multiply each
conventional coordinate by its weight, then append the weight as the control point's last coordinate.
<p><b>NURBS Curves</b><p>
<i>NURBS</i> is an acronym for non-uniform rational B-spline curves.
<p><b>Polynomial Basis</b></p>
<p>Any kind of polynomial curve can be converted to a different kind
of polynomial curve, having the same degree and describing the same path,
by transforming its control points. For example, a Hermite curve (another
kind of polynomial curve) can be converted to the equivalent
B-spline curve this way, or vice versa.
<p>Each kind of polynomial curve (such as B-spline or B&eacute;zier) is
associated with a <i>basis matrix</i>, which defines the polynomial
coefficients for each control point in the curve. For a degree (N-1) curve,
the matrix will be NxN.<p>
Each "column" of a basis matrix is a polynomial equation
containing the coefficients for each control point, and the columns are
arranged from left to right. Each polynomial consists of coefficients, ranging from the
highest order to the lowest, with respect to the parameter
<code>t</code> and the corresponding control point. For example, the
column <code>(3, 4, 2, 10)</code> describes the polynomial
3xt<sup>3</sup> + 4xt<sup>2</sup> + 2xt + 10x, where <code>x</code>
is the input control point. The polynomials
are added together to get the final coordinate of the curve at the
given <code>t</code> value.<p>
The following JavaScript code shows an example of a basis matrix -- the
cubic B&eacute;zier basis matrix.<br>
<pre>var bezierBasisMatrix = [
// For the purposes of the H3DU.Math matrix functions,
// the polynomials are arranged "column-wise", like this:
// P1, P2, P3, P4
-1,3,-3,1,
3,-6,3,0,
-3,3,0,0,
1,0,0,0]</pre>
<p>For code that converts a curve from one kind to
another, see the example.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>controlPoints</code> (Type: Array.&lt;Array.&lt;number>>)<br>An array of control points. Each control point is an array with the same length as the other control points. It is assumed that the first control point's length represents the size of all the control points.<li><code>knots</code> (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<br>Knot vector of the curve. Its size must be at least 2 plus the number of control points and not more than twice the number of control points.<br> The length of this parameter minus 1, minus the number of control points, represents the <i>degree</i> of the B-spline curve. For example, a degree-3 (cubic) B-spline curve contains eight knots, that is, four more knots than the number of control points (four). A degree of 1 results in straight line segments.<br> The knot vector must be a monotonically nondecreasing sequence, the first knot must not equal the last, and the same knot may not be repeated more than N+1 times at the beginning and end of the vector, or more than N times elsewhere, where N is the curve's degree. If the difference between one knot and the next isn't the same, the curve is considered a <i>non-uniform</i> B-spline curve. Usually the first knot will be 0 or less and the last knot will be 1 or greater.<li><code>bits</code> (Type: number) (optional)<br>Bits for defining input and controlling output. Zero or more of <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.WEIGHTED_BIT">H3DU.BSplineCurve.WEIGHTED_BIT</a>, <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.HOMOGENEOUS_BIT">H3DU.BSplineCurve.HOMOGENEOUS_BIT</a>, and <a href="H3DU.BSplineCurve.html#H3DU.BSplineCurve.DIVIDE_BIT">H3DU.BSplineCurve.DIVIDE_BIT</a>. If null, undefined, or omitted, no bits are set.</ul><h4> Example</h4><p>The following code converts a cubic (degree-3)
curve from one kind to another. The converted curve will generally
have the same path as the original curve.</p><pre>
// "srcBasis" is a 4x4 basis matrix for the source curve type;
// the control points will initially be of this type of curve.
// var srcBasis = [ .... ]; // To be supplied or filled in.
// "dstBasis" is a 4x4 basis matrix for the destination curve type.
// It's defined here as the Bezier basis matrix for this example
var dstBasis =[-1,3,-3,1, 3,-6,3,0, -3,3,0,0, 1,0,0,0];
// Step 1: Invert the destination basis matrix
var invertedDest=H3DU.Math.mat4invert(destBasis)
// Step 2: Multiply the inverted destination matrix by the source
// matrix
var resultMatrix=H3DU.Math.mat4multiply(invertedDest,srcBasis)
// Step 3: Convert the control points one dimension
// at a time
var newControlPoints=[[],[],[],[]]
for(var i=0;i &lt; controlPoints[0].length;i++) {
var cp=[controlPoints[0][i],controlPoints[1][i],controlPoints[2][i],
controlPoints[3][i]]
// Transform the control points using the result matrix
cp=H3DU.Math.vec4transform(resultMatrix,cp)
// Set the new coordinates
newControlPoints[0][i]=cp[0]
newControlPoints[1][i]=cp[1]
newControlPoints[2][i]=cp[2]
newControlPoints[3][i]=cp[3]
}
// Finally, generate a Bezier curve (which is a special case
// of a B-spline curve)
var curve=new BSplineCurve(
newControlPoints,
[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1] // cubic Bezier knot vector
);
// Alternatively, the curve could be generated with the

of curve parameterization.<p>
The <i>end points</i> of the curve (obtained by calling the <code>endPoints</code>
method) will be (0, N), where N is the distance to the end of the curve from its
start.<p>
When converting to an arc length parameterization, the curve
should be continuous and have a speed greater than 0 at every
point on the curve. The arc length parameterization used in
this method is approximate.<h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.BSplineCurve.uniform'></a>
