<h3> H3DU.Curve(curve, [curveParam])</h3>A curve evaluator object for a parametric curve.<p>
A parametric curve is a curve whose points are based on a
parametric curve function. A curve function takes a number
(U) and returns a point (in 1 or more dimensions, but
usually 2 or 3) that lies on the curve. For example, in 3
dimensions, a curve function has the following form:<p>
<b>F</b>(u) = [ x(u), y(u), z(u) ]<p>
where x(u) returns an X coordinate, y(u) a Y coordinate,
and z(u) returns a Z coordinate.<p>
Specialized curves should subclass this class and implement
the <code>evaluate</code> method and, optionally, the other methods mentioned in the "curve" parameter below.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>curve</code> (Type: Object)<br>A <b>curve evaluator object</b>, which is an object that must contain an <code>evaluate</code> method and may contain an <code>endPoints</code>, <code>velocity</code>, <code>accel</code>, <code>jerk</code>, <code>normal</code>, and/or <code>arcLength</code> method, as described in the corresponding methods of this class.<li><code>curveParam</code> (Type: Object) (optional)<br>An object for reparameterizing a curve object. It implements a method named <code>endPoints</code>, which has the same meaning as <a href="H3DU.Curve.html#H3DU.Curve_endPoints">H3DU.Curve#endPoints</a> and whose return value takes precedence over the given curve's <code>endPoints</code> method. It also implements a method named <code>getCoordinate(u)</code>, which converts a U coordinate in the old parameterization to a U coordinate in the new parameterization.</ul><h4> Example</h4><p>The following function defines a parametric circle curve. It demonstrates how all methods
defined for curve evaluator objects can be implemented.</p><pre>

return H3DU.Math.vec3normalize(this.accel(u));
},

return u;

<h3> H3DU.Curve#accel(u)</h3>Finds an approximate acceleration vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>accel</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>acceleration</b> of a curve is a vector which is the second-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing an acceleration vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_arcLength'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#arcLength(u)</h3>Finds an approximate arc length (distance) between the start of this
curve and the point at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>arcLength</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, calculates a numerical integral using the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>arc length</b> function returns a number; if the curve is "smooth", this is the integral, from the starting point to <code>u</code>, of the length of the velocity vector.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>The approximate arc length of this curve at the given U coordinate. (Type: number)<a name='H3DU.Curve_changeEnds'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#changeEnds(ep1, ep2)</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that is generated using
the same formula as this one (and uses the same U coordinates),
but has a different set of end points.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the path of a curve
from [0, &pi;] to [0, &pi;/8].<p>
Note, however, that in general, shrinking
the range of a curve will not shrink the length of a curve
in the same proportion, unless the curve's path runs at
constant speed with respect to time. For example, shrinking the range of a curve
from [0, 1] to [0, 0.5] will not generally result in a curve that's exactly half as
long as the original curve.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>ep1</code> (Type: number)<br>New start point of the curve.<li><code>ep2</code> (Type: number)<br>New end point of the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_endPoints'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#endPoints()</h3>Returns the starting and ending U coordinates of this curve.<h4> Return Value</h4>A two-element array. The first element is the starting coordinate of
the curve, and the second is its ending coordinate.
Returns <code>[0, 1]</code> if the evaluator doesn't implement an <code>endPoints</code>
method.<a name='H3DU.Curve_evaluate'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#evaluate(u)</h3>Finds the position of this curve at the given U coordinate.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a position. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_fitRange'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#fitRange(ep1, ep2)</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to fit the given range.
For example, this method can be used to shrink the range of U coordinates
from [-&pi;, &pi;] to [0, 1] without shortening the path of the curve.
Here, -&pi; now maps to 0, and &pi; now maps to 1.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>ep1</code> (Type: number)<br>New value to use as the start point of the curve.<li><code>ep2</code> (Type: number)<br>New value to use as the end point of the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_getLength'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#getLength()</h3>Convenience method for getting the total length of this curve.<h4> Return Value</h4>The distance from the start of the curve to its end. (Type: number)<a name='H3DU.Curve_getPoints'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#getPoints(count)</h3>Gets an array of positions on the curve at fixed intervals
of U coordinates. Note that these positions will not generally be
evenly spaced along the curve unless the curve uses
an arc-length parameterization.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>count</code> (Type: number)<br>Number of positions to generate. Throws an error if this number is 0. If this value is 1, returns an array containing the starting point of this curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array of curve positions. The first
element will be the start of the curve. If "count" is 2 or greater, the last element
will be the end of the curve. (Type: Array.&lt;Array.&lt;number>> | Array.&lt;Object>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_getPointsAsObjects'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#getPointsAsObjects(count)</h3>Gets an array of positions on the curve at fixed intervals
of U coordinates. Note that these positions will not generally be
evenly spaced along the curve unless the curve uses
an arc-length parameterization. The positions will be in the form of objects with
up to four properties: x, y, z, and w retrieve the first, second, third,
and fourth coordinate of each position, respectively.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>count</code> (Type: number)<br>Number of positions to generate. Throws an error if this number is 0. If this value is 1, returns an array containing the starting point of this curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array of curve positions. The first
element will be the start of the curve. If "count" is 2 or greater, the last element
will be the end of the curve. (Type: Array.&lt;Array.&lt;number>> | Array.&lt;Object>)<h4> Example</h4><pre>The following example initializes a three.js BufferGeometry with the points retrieved by this method. This example requires the three.js library.
var points=curve.getPointsAsObjects(50)
var buffer=new THREE.BufferGeometry()
.setFromPoints(points);</pre><a name='H3DU.Curve_jerk'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#jerk(u)</h3>Finds an approximate jerk vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>jerk</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the acceleration vector.<p>
The <b>jerk</b> of a curve is a vector which is the third-order derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a jerk vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_normal'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#normal(u)</h3>Finds an approximate principal normal vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>normal</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using the velocity vector.<p>
The <b>principal normal</b> of a curve is the derivative of the "normalized" velocity
vector divided by that derivative's length. The normal returned by this method
<i>should</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>. (Compare with <a href="H3DU.Surface.html#H3DU.Surface_gradient">H3DU.Surface#gradient</a>.)<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_tangent'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#tangent(u)</h3>Convenience method for finding an approximate tangent vector of this curve at the given U coordinate.
The <b>tangent vector</b> is the same as the velocity vector, but "normalized" to a unit vector.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a normal vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_toArcLengthParam'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#toArcLengthParam()</h3>Creates a curve evaluator object for a curve that follows the same
path as this one but has its U coordinates remapped to
an <i>arc length parameterization</i>. Arc length
parameterization allows for moving along a curve's path at a uniform
speed and for generating points which are spaced evenly along that
path -- both features are more difficult with most other kinds
of curve parameterization.<p>
The <i>end points</i> of the curve (obtained by calling the <code>endPoints</code>
method) will be (0, N), where N is the distance to the end of the curve from its
start.<p>
When converting to an arc length parameterization, the curve
should be continuous and have a speed greater than 0 at every
point on the curve. The arc length parameterization used in
this method is approximate.<h4> Return Value</h4>Return value. (Type: <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a>)<a name='H3DU.Curve_velocity'></a>
<h3> H3DU.Curve#velocity(u)</h3>Finds an approximate velocity vector at the given U coordinate of this curve.
The implementation in <a href="H3DU.Curve.html">H3DU.Curve</a> calls the evaluator's <code>velocity</code>
method if it implements it; otherwise, does a numerical differentiation using
the position (from the <code>evaluate</code> method).<p>
The <b>velocity</b> of a curve is a vector which is the derivative of the curve's position at the given coordinate. The vector returned by this method <i>should not</i> be "normalized" to a <a href="tutorial-glmath.html">unit vector</a>.<h4> Parameters</h4><ul><li><code>u</code> (Type: number)<br>U coordinate of a point on the curve.</ul><h4> Return Value</h4>An array describing a velocity vector. It should have at least as many
elements as the number of dimensions of the underlying curve. (Type: Array.&lt;number>)<p><a href='index.html'>Back to documentation index.</a></p></body></html>
